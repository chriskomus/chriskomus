## My Summary

In my final term of Business Information Technology at RRC, graduating in December 2022, and ready to start my career as a back-end developer, API developer, App developer, or full-stack software developer.

As a Business Information Technology student at RRC, my focus is on software development using C# and .NET framework, Kotlin, PHP, PL/SQL, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, React and Python. As a software developer intern I gained professional experience in Angular, node.js, and Typescript, as well as API development. Before returning to RRC, I came from a "jack of all trades" marketing background, with years of experience in a b2b wholesale environment developing e-commerce solutions, designing for print and web, maintaining large datasets, and reporting on market research using data-driven metrics.

## My Experience

**Marketing** at WR Display & Packaging working on front-end development of open source e-commerce solutions such as X-Cart, working with HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and PHP.
